= SCL Editor - jarradraumati's OpenSCD Core Distribution

The SCL editor is a light weight editor for substation configuration language as defined in the IEC 61850-6.
This editor is been created with a focus on a general user that does want to be close to the process described in the standard and an easy to maintain distribution (for long term stability).

Give it a try on https://jarradraumati.github.io/scl-editor

== Scope

It is not the goal to reach every user of SCL, nor is it the goal to support all history of the standard. Out of scope is for example:

- Edition 1 of the IEC 61850-6
- Support of multi-edition projects

CAUTION: This distribution is in development and must be used with care!
If you found a bug please share with us and write an {uri-distribution-issues}[issue].

== Security

We do NOT upload any information of any sort.
You browser is only downloading never uploading anything.
So when you connect to [SCL editor](https://jarradraumati.github.io/scl-editor) you download/update all the JavaScript files to run the editor in your browser.
That is why you can work offline one you have connected to the page once!
